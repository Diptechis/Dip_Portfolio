# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contact me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Portuguese Bank Marketing Analysis](https://github.com/Diptechis/Portuguese_Bank_Marketing_Analysis)

<img src="images/BI.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Keras, Tensorflow

**Project Objective:** In this project I worked with real world data which is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit.

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify whether client has subscribed the term deposit or not [**85%** Accuracy Using Logistic Regression Algo.](https://github.com/Diptechis/Portuguese_Bank_Marketing_Analysis).

- Added multiple convolution and pooling layers
- Training model on basis of Mnist data
- Data Source: MNIST

[Identifying given picture is a Cat or a Dog](https://github.com/Diptechis/Modified-Convolutional/blob/main/convolutional_NN.ipynb)

<img src="images/Dog-and-Cat.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Keras, Tensorflow

**Project Objective:** Prediction of whether a given image is a Cat or a Dog using Convolutional Neural Networks which may be further implemented as a feature in a bigger project.

**Quantifiable result:** We could train the Convolutional Neural Network to attain a accuracy of [**71%** using **3** epochs](https://github.com/Diptechis/Modified-Convolutional/blob/main/convolutional_NN.ipynb).

- Added multiple convolution and pooling layers
- Training model on basis of given data
- Fitting the CNN to see if the provided image is dog or cat

[Hand-writing Recognition](https://github.com/Diptechis/HandWritten_Digit_CNN)

<img src="images/MD.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Keras, Tensorflow

**Project Objective:** Mnist is a dataset with 70,000 of handwritten digits. Here I have predicted the mnist digits by using Convolution Neural Network.

**Quantifiable result:** We could train the Convolutional Neural Network to attain a accuracy of [**99%** using **10** epochs](https://github.com/Diptechis/HandWritten_Digit_CNN).

- Added multiple convolution and pooling layers
- Training model on basis of Mnist data
